# ZTimer
A simple clock countdown made with Python. To manage your work time, to avoid hurting your health!
___
# Why?
I often coding for a long time without a break time(for 2,3 hours without break time), and that's very awful for my health during a long time. So I made this extremely simple software for managing my work time (For e.x : Set up a countdown for 50 mins, after that take a 10-min break time). Although it's really simple app I made with Python, after a several times using it - my health and performance significantly improved.
